# Voice Assistant Project

This is a voice-controlled virtual assistant project inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man. It uses voice commands to perform tasks like telling the time, opening web pages, or even telling jokes. The assistant also integrates with the Gemini API to handle more advanced commands.

## Features
- Text-to-speech functionality (pyttsx3)
- Voice command recognition (SpeechRecognition)
- Wikipedia integration
- Telling jokes (pyjokes)
- Web browsing (webbrowser)
- Command execution (subprocess)
- Integration with the Gemini API for natural language interaction

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Note
Make sure to replace the Gemini API key (API_KEY) in the script with your own valid API key:
```bash
API_KEY = 'Your-API-Key-Here'
```
